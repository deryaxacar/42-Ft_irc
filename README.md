<p align="center">
The ft_irc project is designed to help students gain proficiency in network programming, socket usage, protocol implementation, and multi-client management. Within the scope of this project, students develop a server that operates in accordance with the IRC (Internet Relay Chat) protocol, allowing them to understand the fundamental building blocks of real-time communication systems. The project aims to teach students how to efficiently manage system resources and build a robust architecture for handling multiple client interactions using low-level C programming.
